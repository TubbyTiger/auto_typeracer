# auto_typeracer CONCEPT

This would normally be done in JS, but out of curiosity and boredom I made a python script for typeracer. It emulates a browser
in which automatically joins the race and inputs the given words. Typeracer detects those who types over 100 wpm and there is no way
to get around it unless you are able to type over 76 wpm reading a given captcha. Obviously I haven't gotten around that

The typeracer text has 2-3 span tags in which break off a part of the text. The first span tag will always carry 1 character and
the following span tag will carry x >= 1 amount of characters. Also to note:  beginning  white spaces cannot be scraped. 

Yes, I was bored enough to do this on a Friday night. Anyways this is more of a concept than a finished project. Feel free to 
play around with this and create a better script.
